        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            Enter your calls in the text box. If the sequencer does not understand
            your call or cannot perform it, it will show a brief message.
        </p>

        <p>
            To save a sequence, tap the &quot;share&quot; icon at the top which
            looks like three connected dots.  You will see a list of apps that are
            willing to accept the text, some more appropriate than others.
        </p>

        <p>
            To erase the current sequence and start a new one, tap the
            Formation button and select the formation.
        </p>

        <h2>What the Sequencer Can Do</h2>
        <p>
            Any call illustrated in Taminations can be used if the formation matches.
            In addition, some simple calls and modifiers are programmed so they can be
            used in any appropriate formation.  These include
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Designators:</b> Boys/Girls, Beaus/Belles, Leaders/Trailers, Ends/Centers/Very Centers</li>
            <li>
                <b>Calls:</b> Run/Cross Run, Face In/Out/Left/Right, Quarter In/Out,
                Pass Thru, Slip, Slide Thru, Turn Back, Wheel Around, Zig/Zag
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Modifiers and Concepts:</b> Roll, Spread,
                Half &lt;anything&gt;, &lt;anything&gt; Once and a Half
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What the Sequencer Cannot Do</h2>
        <p>
            Except for the simple programmed calls listed above, the sequencer can only
            do calls that it can find in Taminations.  For example, it will not do
            Heads Flutterwheel because there's no animation for that call.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sequencer does not know much about Challenge concepts.  There
            are several other programs that are much better at writing Challenge
            coreography.
        </p>

        <h2>This is a New Feature</h2>
        <p>
            Any and all <a href="mailto:brad@bradchristie.com?Subject=Taminations%20sequencer">feedback</a> is appreciated.  You may find
            things that don't work right.  Also feel free to let me know features you would
            like added next.
